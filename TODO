- rewrite restful routes test strategy unfold_resourceful_routesets is bad
- rename spec descriptions so they make more sense semantically

SPECIAL CASES

- See the Globbing thing. In rack_router it returns a string, rails returns an array split by segment delimiter. Currently there's no entry point in the rack_router to post-format the capture nor to now what kind of capture it is. See that later as its not used that often. I've commented the globbing spec in connect_spec.rb

- name options to create new routes. I didn't even now that existed. map.resources :photos, :new => { :upload => :post }
shouldn't just use :collection => { :upload => :post }
