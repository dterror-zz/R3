- rename spec descriptions so they make more sense semantically
- learn to inject error messages in #unfold_restful_routeset in spec_helper, make it more granular

MISSING SPECS
- with_options
- restful_routes
	- namespace


SPECIAL CASES SPECS
- See the Gobbling thing. In rack_router it returns a string, rails returns an array split by segment delimiter. Currently there's no entry point in the rack_router to post-format the capture nor to now what kind of capture it is. See that later as its not used that often. I've commented the globbing spec in connect_spec.rb
