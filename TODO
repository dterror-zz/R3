- solve pending specs
- refactor spec_helper
- see html as a default, it doesn't need to be passed every time in parameters

SPECIAL CASES (PENDING)

- See the Globbing thing. In rack_router it returns a string, rails returns an array split by segment delimiter. Currently there's no entry point in the rack_router to post-format the capture nor to know what kind of capture it is. See that later as its not used that often. I've commented the globbing spec in connect_spec.rb

- name options to create new routes. I didn't even now that existed.
 	map.resources :photos, :new => { :upload => :post }
	shouldn't just use :collection => { :upload => :post }
