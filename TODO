- refactor builder#add_route
- sleep
- rename spec descriptions so they make more sense semantically, but that's definitely after sleep


MISSING SPECS
- with_options
- restful_routes



SPECIAL CASES SPECS
- See the Gobbling thing. In rack_router it returns a string, rails returns an array split by segment delimiter. Currently there's no entry point in the rack_router to post-format the capture nor to now what kind of capture it is. See that later as its not used that often. I've commented the globbing spec in connect_spec.rb
